# pymsb
An open source implementation of the Microsoft Small Basic language.

The goal of this project is to produce a more stable, cross-platform and more readily updated implementation of the Microsoft Small Basic language.  (I was originally inspired to do this when the 1.0 release of MSB crashed whenever using GraphicsWindow.GetPixel, and this release seemed to be the final release for years).
