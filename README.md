# pymsb
An open-source, cross-platform interpreter for the Microsoft Small Basic language.  

The goal is to create a more stable and bug-free implementation of the language than Microsoft's proprietary IDE, that will work in Windows, Mac OS X and Linux (Ubuntu, at the very least).  Currently, the interpreter works for a subset of the language features, with the most notable omission at the moment being support events (like in Timer).

## Installation
PyMSB is currently being tested on Windows 7 and Linux Mint.  Mac OS X support will come in the future, after PyMSB development is feature-complete on Windows and Linux.

1. Install Python 3.  
 * On Linux, use the command `sudo apt-get install python3` in the terminal.
 * On Windows, download the latest version of Python 3 from https://www.python.org/download/.
