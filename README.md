# pymsb
An open-source, cross-platform interpreter for the Microsoft Small Basic language.  

The goal is to create a more stable and bug-free implementation of the language than Microsoft's proprietary IDE.  I was inspired to do this when I noticed countless bugs in the 1.0 release of Microsoft Small Basic, and the development status of the language seemed unclear for a long time.

This is an active work in progress, with most of the current focus on implementing the core syntactic elements of the language before anything flashy, like graphics, turtles and Flickr APIs.
